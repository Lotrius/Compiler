Fixed compilation issues

-------------------------------------------------------------------
I reworked the lexer a bit to fix some of the logic and make it work with the parser.The parser part works, but there is a small error in the lexer that is causing errors. I added a space in the test file that somehow makes it parse correctly. I will fix the lexer.

You need to be within the Parser file to be able to run the program.

The output is displayed on both the terminal and also the file parseout.txt.
