I reworked the lexer a bit to fix some of the logic and make it work with the parser.The parser part works, but there is a small error in the lexer that is causing errors. I added a space in the test file that somehow makes it parse correctly. I will fix the lexer.

You need to be within the Parser file to be able to run the program.

Once you click build, type java -jar "C:\Users\Father\Desktop\Compiler\Compiler\dist\Compiler.jar" Test.txt to run the program.

The output is displayed on both the terminal and also the file parseout.txt.
